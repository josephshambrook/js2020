I'm currently on the OnePlus 7T, but I've been pretty disappointed by the stock camera (especially after upgrading from the Pixel 3 XL, which had the best phone camera I'd ever seen but shit battery life). I'm probably going to jump back over to iPhone when the 12 is released (I was highly tempted by the 11 Pro) if it meets what I want to see, and iOS has made some fairly decent ground on matching Android's customisation perks.",

I've also made use of containers to further limit how much Facebook and Google can track me across websites. It's a relatively minor move towards protecting my information, and I could extend it further, but it helps me feel better whilst browsing the web.",

It's helped me to budget for my wedding, holidays, my young family and a deposit for a house. It takes time to get it right, but once I did, I can't imagine using another budget tool.",
