Hello, again.

I've written, and rewritten, a personal website for myself a number of times over the last few years. It never gets easier, especially as I'm my own worst critic. This time though, was different.

I finally figured out that it was okay to do tiny tasks and do them well, than get held up with larger tasks that become a chore. Chores like removing a load of bloat from a starter template, or getting bogged down by minor design decisions. Now, I was prioritising the smaller tasks and getting them done, which helped make the site feel gradually more "complete", and the harder tasks more digestable.

This seems like such a simple thing to understand and adopt, and yet I found it too easy to get overwhelmed by a task to the point where I sodded the project to hell for the next time inspiration hit.

There was a spark that got me going though; the logo.
