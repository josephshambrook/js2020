# JS 2020

My personal website, which I've only bothered to start taking serious halfway through the year. Built on [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and using the [XITY Starter scaffold project](https://github.com/equinusocio/xity-starter).

## Usage

Install all the dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the local development mode

This command will run `parcel` and the local server (with [Browsersync][]) with auto reload.

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Building the production version

To generate your static site/blog you can run the following command. It will prepare the content assets and run optimisations for a production release.

```bash
yarn build
```
